# iiec-rise-python

This python script uses OS module and helps to perform some of the tasks that is required by System Admin.

I haven't used subprocesses, sys module which can be more efficient in featuring more stuffs.
Only used content which was taught till the date
This can be made more effective using search patterns regex modules (its known to me but not used as its not covered yet)

NOTE : Some of the utilities have been unsupported while running on various platform based on its availability and compatibility.
